      Forestry.io is a Git-based CMS (content management system) for websites and web products built using static site generators. Forestry bridges the gap between developers and their teams, by making development fun and easy, while providing powerful content management for their teams.

      Forestry powers static sites generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.org) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and manages them using Git.
