## Features

* **Datafile Sections:** Sections will now import data files (`.json`, `.yaml`, and `.toml`). This is a replacement for the current method of importing datafiles. 
  * All new sites will have this feature enabled by default.
  * Users with existing VuePress sites will also have this feature enabled.
  * Existing Jekyll and Hugo sites will continue to use the old method of importing datafiles. You may opt-in to the new importing method from the settings page for your site.
