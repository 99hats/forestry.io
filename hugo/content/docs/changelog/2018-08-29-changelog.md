## Enhancements

* **Directory Sections:** A new `exclude` glob can be set to exclude files from your directory sections. 
* **Jekyll Pages Sections:** Forestry now respects the `exclude` file found in your [Jekyll config](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/ "Jekyll Configuration").

## Bug Fixes

* **Bitbucket SSH Setup:** During the setup of a new Bitbucket repo, Forestry now links directly to the Bitbucket page where you can upload the SSH key.
