## Bug Fixes

* **Creating Documents:** Fixed a bug which told the users that they had no FMTs if the section had no valid templates listed.
* **Validation:** Fixed a widely used form validator that would sometimes blow up.

## Enhancements

* **Timezone Settings:**  Added some descriptive text clarifying the purpose of the timezone in Settings > General.
* **User Interface:** Increased the consistency of the user interface styling in a number of small ways.

## Beta

* **Front Matter Template UI:** We made a lot of progress this week on the new Front Matter Template forms. Improvements to errors, settings, and most of the nested fields interface.
