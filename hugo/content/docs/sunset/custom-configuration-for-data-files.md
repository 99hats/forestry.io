Previously we made it possible to customize the sidebar for your content files (i.e. .md and .html). With this update we expand that capability to data files. You can now use the sidebar settings to import other file formats (e.g. .json, .toml, .yml) and choose how they are displayed.

All new sites will have this feature enabled by default. Existing Jekyll and Hugo sites have to migrate their sites manually by October 16th, 2018.

Visit ourÂ [docs](/docs/editing/data-files#existing-jekyll-hugo-projects) to learn more about how this might impact your data files or see our [walkthrough](/blog/custom-configuration-for-data-files/) to make the change now.
