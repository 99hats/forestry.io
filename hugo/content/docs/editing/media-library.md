The Media Library allows content editors to easily manage the media for your site. This allows content editors to easily add images, PDFs, and GIFs to their content without having to use Git.

## Managing Media

The Media Library allows you to upload and delete media files. It also allows editors to insert media uploads into the [File Upload](/docs/settings/fields#file-upload) and [Multi-File Upload](/docs/settings/fields#multi-file-upload) front matter fields, and the content body.

### Uploading Media

To upload media files to the Media Library, navigate to the _Media Library_ page in Forestry, and follow these instructions:

1. Click the "+" thumbnail
2. Select a media file to upload from your local machine
3. A loading spinner will be displayed while the media file uploads
