Forestry supports storing your media in your own [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html).

## Linking Your S3 Bucket

If this is your first time creating a bucket simply keep the default settings if not mentioned otherwise.

## AWS S3 Configuration

 1. [Sign up for an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
 2. Log in to your dashboard and open the _Services_ dropdown in the top bar then click on the **S3** service.
 3. Create a Bucket and make note of the Bucket name for later. In the _Set Permissions_ step ensure to uncheck the following options:
    * **Block new public ACLs and uploading public objects**
    * **Remove public access granted through public ACLs**
 4. Create User Credentials with a IAM Service. Open _Services_ and select the **IAM** service.
 5. Navigate to _Users_ and click on **Add User**.
 6. Grant **Programmatic access** to create an _access key ID_Â andÂ _secret access key._
 7. Choose **Attach existing policies directly** and click on **Create Policy** in the _Set Permissions_ step.

    _Possible permissions for your policy_ ðŸ‘†
 8. Select your newly created policy as your user's permissions and finish the creation of your new user.

 9. Take note of the **Access key ID** and the **Secret access key** and navigate to the _Media_ tab on your site's _Settings_ in Forestry
10. Select **Amazon** **S3** as a _Media Storage Provider_ and fill in the **Bucket**, **Access Key** and **Secret**. Click on _Save Media Settings_ and upload an image in the _Media_ section. You are now connected to your S3 bucket.

## Recommended Path Settings

You will want to adjust your paths in the **Media** section to work with S3.

* **Public Path**: You should enter the full URL to your S3 bucket. This will look something like `https://``{{ REGION }}``.amazonaws.com/``{{ BUCKET_NAME }}/`.
  {{% tip %}}
  {{ REGION }} usually looks something like `s3-us-west-2` except for the US EAST (North Virgina) region which is simply `s3`.
  {{% /tip %}}
* **Front Matter Path:** Activate the toggle in this section to use a different **public path** when inserting an image into front matter, and leave the value empty. This will allow you to easily insert URL transformations ([see below](#using-cloudinary-images)).

### Applying transforms to markdown content

Your markdown content will not have any transforms applied by default. To apply transforms to all of your markdown images, you can use the **public path** and **front matter path** separately.

E.g:

* **Public Path:** `[https://res.cloudinary.com/](https://res.cloudinary.com/ "https://res.cloudinary.com/")``{{ CLOUD_NAME }}/image/upload/c_scale,w_auto:100,dpr_auto/`
* **Front Matter Path:** `[https://res.cloudinary.com/](https://res.cloudinary.com/ "https://res.cloudinary.com/")``{{ CLOUD_NAME }}/image/upload/`

## Migrating Existing Media

Currently, we are not able to automatically migrate existing media from a git repo to a user's Cloudinary account. We recommend logging in to your Cloudinary dashboard and bulk uploading your images there. After the images are in your Cloudinary account, they will also appear in your Media Library in Forestry.

Unfortunately, for the time being, you will need to manually update your front matter to reassign the new images.

## Using Cloudinary Images

Cloudinary supports a vast array of image manipulation options that can be implemented directly in the image URL. Cloudinary has [so many transformation options](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations) that, rather than attempt to support a subset of them in our UI, we have instead decided to make it easy for developers to configure these image transformations themselves in the site's templates.

When adding a Cloudinary image to a front matter field, Forestry will only save the base filename in the page's front matter, like this:

    ---
    main_image: img.png
    #...
    ---

When using these images in your templates, you should prepend them with the URL to your cloud. We recommend storing this URL in your site's configuration and referencing it via variable in your templates. For example, in a Hugo site you might put the following in `config.toml`:

    cloudinary_url = "https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/"

You could then use these front matter images in your templates as follows:

    <img src="{{ .Site.cloudinary_url }}/{{ .Params.main_image }}" />

Using this approach, adding in one or more transformations is easy and transparent:

    <img src="{{ .Site.cloudinary_url }}/w_250,h_250,c_fill/{{ .Params.main_image }}">
