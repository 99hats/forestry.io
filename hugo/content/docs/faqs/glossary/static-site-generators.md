Static Site Generators are developer tools that convert various data formats into [static sites](/docs/faqs/glossary/static-sites).

These data formats are generally [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) stored in a Git repository. They can also be data pulled from third-party services.

## Examples
- [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com): is the static site generator developed by [GitHub](https://github.com) founder, Tom Preston Werner.
- [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io): in Hugo, this is any file in the `staticDir`, which defaults to `static/`
