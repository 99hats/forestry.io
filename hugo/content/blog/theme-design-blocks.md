In April we announced a feature that we believed was a game-changer for static site content managers. Blocks was here to introduce a way for you to put together sites using pre-composed site snippets inside Forestry.

While we did our best to show you how to set them up and give you an idea of how powerful they could be, we noticed that getting to know Blocks and figuring out how to set them up from scratch wasn't as easy as we had hoped. We needed something that would guide people to success.

## Solution

Enter our brand-new theme for Jekyll and Hugo - uBuild (see the live demo here)! This fully-responsive theme comes with 16 design blocks to put together your favorite site. Our norwegian designer made sure it looked stunning but see for yourself.

<div id="import-ubuild-theme-button" data-proofer-ignore>
{{% create_site_button
repo="https://github.com/forestryio/forestry-blocks.git"
configPath="site"
branch="master"
engineName="jekyll"
engineVersion="3.6.0"
forkName="jekyll-ubuild"
heading="Make it Your Own"
linkText="Import Jekyll uBuild Now" %}}
</div>

## Theme introduction

## Purpose

This theme is created to give you a starting point for adding builder functionalities to your own site or just take it and add your own components to it.

## Future

We have big plans for Blocks!

An open-source theme is a great start but we understand that won't fulfill all your needs. We'd like to build an entire Blocks suite from which you can pick and choose as you desire. So as we proceed with our exploration of this tool we're going to add to it and to do that we'd love to have your [feedback and contributions]().

Anything that could be assembled with pre-defined code blocks can be build with Blocks. We'd love to share with the community what you built using Forestry Blocks. Just write us in the comments, slack or tag us on twitter.
