The WYSIWYG Editor / HTML Editor has proven to be less and less the state-of-the-art content editing experience it once set out to be. Considering the issues the WYSIWYG Editor causes and the merits Markdown provides we made the decision to discontinue our WYSIWYG / HTML Editor on 5/11/2018. 

For those users that continue to use HTML over Markdown the Source View Editor continues to be available.

Since Markdown proves to be increasingly ubiquitous, we want to lay out clearly why we believe Markdown is the future and how you can make the move as well.

## Future-Proof Markdown

WYSIWYG Editors were created for a valid reason - HTML is hard to read and content editors shouldn't need to learn HTML to structure and write content. However, they are notoriously known for creating clunky, unreadable, hard to maintain code, affecting not only the well-being of your developers but also your ability to rank of search engines.

Markdown maintains a simple readable text (e.g. ** **word** ** _ _word_ _ ) that can be converted into consistent HTML. The styling will be applied separately and can be easily migrated to a new design without having to alter the content itself. 

With WYSIWYG Editors you often don't know whether content was formatted consistently without going into the code (e.g. H1 can often look similar to a larger sized font that was set to bold). Markdown takes care of this issue by forcing a consistent mark up through limiting options.

However, the big caveat is that editors won't be able to immediately see the styling of a heading, bold, italic or linked word it can make adoption slightly more difficult for non-tech users.

To help with that content editors in Forestry.io use a Markdown editor that provides a simplified formatting giving content editors control over the styling of their article.

At Forestry.io we want to provide you with the best content editing experience and we believe Markdown gives us the simplicity to start creating content for static sites right away and the flexibility to further improve your editor over time.

<!-- Why are we going to discontinue WYSIWYG?
 - List the shortcomings of HTML Editors
 	-> Problematic Code
 	-> Few editors are designers and few designers are happy with just using WYSIWYG at the least they use a combination
	- Fact is, however, for a modern website to have a consistent look is that editors do not and should not have the full capability to customize on a blog article basis.
	- SEO optimization and Disability-friendly websites are pretty difficult to get right with WYSIWIG
	- It should rather be pre-defined styles applied to a content editors copy -> Markdown (good start)
	-> False sense of what is/should be possible
 - What are the benefits of WYSIWIG?
 	-> Immediately seeing what the end product looks like
 - List the benefits of Markdown
 	-> Performance
 	-> Uniformity
 	-> Migration / Flexibility
 	Not only is Markdown easier to type and read, it’s accessible to someone who doesn’t know the first thing about HTML. There are no extra words or letters, the link looks like a footnote readers are used to seeing, and asterisks around a word convey emphasis even if you don’t know which is italics and which is bold.
 - Provide a reassurance that we are working on solving the shortcomings of markdown
 	-> Current Markdown Editor is giving visual cues with bolded text, linked text and images in the text as well as a toolbar at the bottom at the same time those familiar with the Markdown syntax can choose the raw markdown view and type away. 

Provide Possible Solutions to Migrating from HTML to Markdown

Make sure to state that it will still be possible for people to use the HTML editor for 30 days and after that Source Code is still an option with the HTML Source Code Editor -->
