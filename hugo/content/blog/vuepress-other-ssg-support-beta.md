Support for Vuepress + Other SSGs is here.

This is a big announcement for us and we've been looking forward to making it for quite some time now. So let me walk you through what is new.

***

## Import your Vuepress or Other Project

You can now select your Vuepress project in our options when you add a new site. Actually, you can add any Static Site Generator to Forestry now.

## Configure Your Sidebar

After your import we'll ask you to configure your sidebar. Simply click the link or go to `Settings` and select the `Sidebar` tab. Check out the [docs]()

## Site and Branch at-a-glance ðŸ‘€

Working on different sites with multiple branches that all live in Forestry? They just got a lot easier to navigate. Each site now features the site name and branch in the top of your sidebar. No more clicking around, it's now all out in the open.
