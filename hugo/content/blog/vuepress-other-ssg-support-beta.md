Support for Vuepress + Other SSGs is here.

This is a big announcement for us and we've been looking forward to making it for quite some time now. So let me walk you through importing your project in two steps.

***

## 1. Import your Vuepress or Other Project

You can now select your Vuepress project in our options when you add a new site. In fact, you can add any project that is using .md or .html fies and edit them in Forestry now.

## 2. Configure Your Sidebar

After your import we'll ask you to configure your sidebar. Simply click the link after your import or go to `Settings` and select the `Sidebar` tab. Check out the [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/content-sections/) for more information.

## Add Headings and Single Documents to Your Sidebar

With our latest update we've also included the ability to add section headings such as (`data` or `site`) and single files to your sidebar.
