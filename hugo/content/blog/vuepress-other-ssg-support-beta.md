Support for Vuepress + Other SSGs is here.

If you have a look at our [launch on Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/forestry) almost two years ago the vision to expand the capabilities of our content management tool to other SSGs was already there.

It took us some time to polish the Forestry experience and a few unexpected features that took priority but today it is finally here, we're adding support for Vuepress and other SSGs.

This is a big announcement for us and we're looking forward to hearing what you have to say about it. So let me walk you through importing your first Vuepress project in two steps.

<div id="ELEMENT_ID" data-proofer-ignore>
{{% create_site_button
repo="https://github.com/Germoe/vuepress-homepage"
branch="master"
engineName="vuepress"
engineVersion="0.12.0"
forkName="vuepress-homepage"
heading="You don't have a Vuepress Project? No Problem."
linkText="Import Vuepress Portfolio Theme" %}}
</div>

***

## 1. Import your Vuepress or Other Project

You can now select your Vuepress project in our options when you add a new site. In fact, you can add any project that is using .md or .html fies and edit them in Forestry now.

## 2. Configure Your Sidebar

After your import we'll ask you to configure your sidebar. Simply click the link after your import or go to `Settings` and select the `Sidebar` tab. Check out the [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/content-sections/) for more information.

## Add Headings and Single Documents to Your Sidebar

With our latest update we've also included the ability to add section headings such as (`data` or `site`) and single files to your sidebar.

This time more than other times it is important that you give us feedback on what is working for you, what isn't and what features you will need.
