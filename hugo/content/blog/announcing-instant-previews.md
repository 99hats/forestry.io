Today we're happy to announce a major improvement to the way you can preview your content in Forestry. Instant Previews allow you to incrementally update your site, dramatically reducing the time to create your preview.

Add some type of mission (Forestry strives to make content editing as simple as possible, previews are an integral part to updating content, inching closer to the speed you'd have in a local environment is essential)

Why is this an issue?

Content Creators sometimes need to wait a long time for previews to be created, backed up tasks can become a problem, especially as your site grows. Updates need to be done in order.  
  
However, previews take up a big part of that time. I've noticed myself getting pulled out of my focus waiting for the preview to update.

How did it work so far?  
The general preview system builds your site from scratch every time  

How does it work now?

Spin up your own preview server, Feature will have a 100 GB of free previews a month, which is enough for most sites to use this feature with no additional costs. This data limit is only going to impact users with media-heavy sites or otherwise very large sites.
