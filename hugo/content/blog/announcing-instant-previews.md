Today we're happy to announce a faster way to preview your content in Forestry. Instant Previews allow you to incrementally update your site, dramatically reducing the time to create your preview.

## Why Instant Previews?

At Forestry we strive to make your content editing experience as seamless as possible and closing in on the speed of editing in your local environment is one of the keys to achieving that goal. Anybody we spoke to made it clear: speedy previews are what Forestry needs!

### Better Editing

Fast previews are essential for a great editing experience. Writing an article, editors need to have an idea of what that text, that headline and that image is going to look like in its final state. This usually means a lot of clicking back and forth between editor and site, any delay here can frustrate and significantly impact time-to-publish.

Moreover, delays disruptive to focus and thoughts. Writing is an inherently creative task, getting into the "zone" is essential to achieve great results. A delayed preview can rip you out of the deep state of mind and makes you lose that important spark or train of thought.

### Large Sites

Depending on your static site generator a large site can cause a significant headache. Waiting ten minutes for a site to build might be acceptable for deployment but it's not workable for reviewing and previewing a post, page or article.

**In short: Delays... Are... A... Big... Issue...**

## What do Instant Previews do?

Using regular Previews, Forestry builds your previews just like your deployments. Every time you click on the Preview Button, Forestry builds your entire site from scratch. That's not super efficient for previewing.

### Spin up a Development Server

Most static site generators have a `preview command` that allows for incremental updates. This makes your previews much faster.

Now Instant Previews allows you to take advantage of these commands by running your own development server in our preview environment.

### Skip the Queue

It gets even better, Instant Previews allow you to update regardless of what's in the queue. With the regular Preview system you can come into the position of waiting for your preview to be backed up in the queue behind other tasks. Because regular Previews are generally handled like other jobs in our queue, they can't be cancelled and have to be completed in order.

With Instant Previews this bottleneck is removed, whether or not your previous jobs have been completed, your preview will be updated without delay and delivered as soon as it's ready.

### Regular Previews vs Instant Previews

The best way to show off the power of Instant Previews is by seeing them in action.

## Setting up Instant Previews

Navigate to your `Previews` settings and switch `Instant Previews` to on.

Now add your preview command and the necessary additional parameters. [Learn More](/docs/instant-previews/)

{{% code_tabs %}} {{% tab "Hugo" %}}

    hugo server --renderToDisk --port 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "Jekyll" %}}

    bundle exec jekyll serve --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "VuePress" %}}

    vuepress dev --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Gatsby \[beta\]" %}}

    gatsby develop -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0

{{% /tab %}} {{% /code_tabs %}}

That's it! You're all set.

To debug your previews we've provided you the log in your `Previews` settings.

{{% tip %}}

Currently, this feature has a 100 GB limit per month/per site. This should be more than enough for most sites to use this feature with no additional costs.

The data limit might impact users with very media-heavy sites or otherwise large sites. Forestry will make sure that you're contacted once you hit the data limit.
