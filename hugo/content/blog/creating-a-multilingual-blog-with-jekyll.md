Reaching an international audience means having international content. Having your content available in multiple languages is great for maximizing your potential audience. On top of that, ensuring your multilingual siteâ€™s content is easy to edit is especially important, to enable translators without development experience to work effectively and reduce the incidence of translation errors.

In this post, I will explore how to set up a Jekyll site to support multiple languages, and use Forestry to provide an interface for creating translations.

## Simple i18n in Jekyll

Jekyll doesnâ€™t have support for multi-language sites baked in, but there are many solutions out there that can make it happen. For this post, I wanted to find a solution that was simple to understand and didnâ€™t require any plugins. My favorite solution came from [this blog post](http://chocanto.me/2016/04/16/jekyll-multilingual.html) by Anthony Granger. His strategy involves having a separate path for each languageâ€™s content, and using a couple front matter values to tie things together.

The example site I created for this post uses the popular Hyde theme, and demonstrates a site with a couple of posts and pages in both English and Spanish. In order to make the Hyde theme fit my multilingual strategy, I only had to make a few modifications.

### Separate Languages By Path

Content for each language exists in its own folder based on the **language code**. Here is a simplified version of my file structure, with separate `en` and `es` directories:

    _includes/
    _layouts/
    en/
      _posts/
        2018-08-03-welcome-to-my-blog.md
      index.md
    es/
      _posts/
        2018-08-03-bienvenido-a-mi-blog.md
      index.md
    public/
    _config.yml

Anthonyâ€™s example kept the English content at the top level of the project, but I decided to place it in its own `en` directory. I find this makes it easier to keep content organized, but the downside is that we will have to build a new homepage, since the user now needs to navigate to `/en/` to see the English content (more on that in a moment.)

### Use Front Matter To Identify Languages and Link Posts

The key to this strategy lies in the use of front matter. We are using the `lang` key to identify the language that this post is in, and another key called `lang-ref`. `lang-ref` will store a string that uniquely identifies this post. When we create a translation of a post, we should use the same value for `lang-ref` so that we can link both translations together. The `lang-ref` value will identify the two translations as having the same content.

_en/_posts/2018-08-03-welcome-to-my-blog.md_

    ---
    layout: post
    title: Welcome to my blog!
    lang: en
    lang-ref: welcome-to-my-blog
    ---
    
    Welcome to my blog!

_es/_posts/2018-08-03-bienvenido-a-mi-blog.md_

    ---
    title: Â¡Bienvenido a mi blog!
    layout: post
    lang: es
    lang-ref: welcome-to-my-blog
    ---
    
    Â¡Bienvenido a mi blog!

Another way to link posts together would be by keeping their filenames the same, but using `lang-ref` allows us to use different filenames, and thus translate our URLs as well as the content.

To display alternate translation options for each post, I created a file at `_includes/footer.html` and included it in the default layout.

    {% if page.layout != 'index' %}
        {% assign posts=site.posts | where:"lang-ref", page.lang-ref | sort: 'lang' %}
        {% if posts.size == 0 %}
            {% assign posts=site.pages | where:"lang-ref", page.lang-ref | sort: 'lang' %}
        {% endif %}
        {% if posts.size > 1 %}
        <footer class="lang-options">
            <em>Read this page in a different language:</em>
            <ul>
            {% for post in posts %}
            <li><a href="{{ site.base-url }}{{ post.url }}" class="{{ post.lang }} title="View in {{page.lang}}">{{ page.lang }}</a></li>
            {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        </div>
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

This code runs on single posts and pages, and searches for all content with a matching `lang-ref` attribute. If it finds more than one match (one match would be the current translation,) it will display all of the language options:

![](/uploads/2018/08/translation-options.png)

We can use this same loop in `_includes/head.html` to include `link` tags denoting the alternate versions of the current page. This will help search engines accurately index your site.

    {% if page.layout != 'index' %}
      {% assign posts=site.posts | where:"lang-ref", page.lang-ref | sort: 'lang' %}
      {% if posts.size == 0 %}
        {% assign posts=site.pages | where:"lang-ref", page.lang-ref | sort: 'lang' %}
      {% endif %}
      {% if posts.size > 1 %}
        {% for post in posts %}
      <link rel="alternate" hreflang="{{post.lang}}" href="{{ site.base-url }}{{ post.url }}" />
        {% endfor %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

### Create Data Files for Translations and Language Metadata

There are a couple more things I want to add to improve the experience of using this site. First, I want to display the full name of the language instead of just the language code in our navigation. Second, there are elements of our layout that I have hard-coded in English. We should be translating that stuff too!

For the first part, Iâ€™ve added a `languages.yml` file in the `_data/` directory to add metadata to our supported languages. For each language code, Iâ€™ve added the full name of the language and an emoji of a corresponding flag.

__data/languages.yml:_

    en:
      label: English
      icon: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
    es:
      label: EspaÃ±ol
      icon: ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

This also serves as a list of all of our supported languages, which will come in handy later. We can use this data by referencing the `site.data.languages` variable in our layout code. To improve the language selector, we can replace the language text:

    {{ post.lang }}

With the following:

    {{ site.data.languages[post.lang].icon }} {{ site.data.languages[post.lang].label }}

![](/uploads/2018/08/translation-options-improved.png)

Our language selector looks much nicer now!

To translate text used in layout files, Iâ€™m using a `translations.yml` file to store translations of arbitrary text that we might want to use in our layouts. Our translation files organizes translations by a specified identifier, as opposed to looking them up based on an English phrase. This allows us to change the English text as well as the translations without breaking anything.

__data/translations.yml_

    relatedPosts:
      en: "Related Posts"
      es: "ArtÃ­culos Relacionados"
    differentLanguage:
      en: "Read this page in a different language"
      es: "Lea esta pÃ¡gina en un idioma diferente"

So for example, in our `_includes/footer.html` file, we can replace the following line:

    <em>Read this page in a different language:</em>

With this:

    <em>{{ site.data.translations['differentLanguage'][page.lang] }}:</em>

We can now see the translated text in our layout:

### Add Language Filters To Post/Page Loops

One issue we run into with adapting the Hyde theme is that any time a list of posts or pages is created, it includes content across all of our available languages. Ideally, we will only show content whose `lang` attribute matches the current language.

To fix this, we just need to edit Hydeâ€™s related posts loop in `_layouts/post.html`  to apply a `where` filter:

    {% assign related = site.related_posts | where:"lang", page.lang %}
    {% if related.size > 0 %}
      {% for post in related limit: 3 %}
      ...
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}

Weâ€™ve swapped out the original `for post in site.related_posts` for a different structure that uses the `where` filter to only include posts that have the same language as the current page.

I also tweaked the menu code in `_includes/sidebar.html`. This code originally looped through all of the pages on the site and displayed the ones with a layout of `page` in a navigation menu. We can use the same restructuring to only include pages inside the same language scope:

    {% assign pages_list = site.pages | where:"lang", page.lang %}
    {% for node in pages_list %}
    ...
    {% endfor %}

Itâ€™s worth noting that Iâ€™ve also adapted Hydeâ€™s original `index.html` homepage file into a layout at `_layouts/index.html`. Iâ€™ve tweaked the original posts loop to also apply this `where` filter to the collection:

    {% assign posts = site.posts | where:"lang", page.lang %}
    {% for post in posts %}
    ...
    {% endfor %}

### Replace Homepage

Since we put all of our english content inside of `/en/`, When a user visits the homepage, the site doesnâ€™t know which language to display. We can address this by adding a splash page to the homepage where a user can select their language.

The splash page loops over the languages defined in `_data/languages.yml` and displays a link to the section.

    <ul class="languages">
    {% for lang in site.data.languages %}
    {% assign language = lang[1] %}
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{lang[0]}}">{{language.icon}} {{ language.label }} ({{ language.code }})</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

## Setting Up The Editing Interface in Forestry

Forestryâ€™s UI for static sites can significantly streamline the editing experience for your translators, and help them make the right decisions. Weâ€™re going to take advantage of Forestryâ€™s configurable sidebar to help our translators add their content correctly.

To access the sidebar configuration, click on **Settings** in the sidebar and navigate to the **Sidebar** tab. You can add, edit, and remove sidebar sections here.

After first importing our site, we are faced with a default configuration for our posts and pages. We will be removing these and replacing them with our language-scoped sections.

Once the existing sections are removed, we can click **Add Section** to open the section creation modal. All of our sections will be of type **Directory**. For our English posts, we can use a label of **English - Posts**. Under **Path**, we will enter the path to our content. In this case, we will enter `en/_posts` to only display content located in that directory.

The **match** option takes a glob which can be used to filter which files and subdirectories are identified as content. For our purposes the default of `\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\*/\\\\\\\*` will work fine to match everything in this directory.
