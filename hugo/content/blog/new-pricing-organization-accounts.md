We’re excited to announce new pricing and Organization Accounts.

Now, the Personal plan supports unlimited sites and up to 3 free Guest users per site (a “Guest” is a single-site user with limited permissions, similar to an “editor”).  The Business plan also supports unlimited sites and is designed for larger teams who need to manage many users across their sites and branches.  Finally, our Enterprise plan is designed for large organizations and offers enterprise-only features.

## Better for simple sites

With our previous free plan, you were charged for each site that had multiple users and we felt it was too restrictive for people building simple static sites.

This dawned on me when my brother got his annual Bluehost bill for his band’s WordPress site (approx $100). Instead of paying it, he asked me to migrate his site from WordPress to Forestry + AWS, which would reduce his hosting to about $1/month. After migrating his site, I realized that even though the Forestry fee was small, we didn’t think it should be required for such a small site.  For simple static websites (sites for bands, restaurants, non-profits, etc), hosting is essentially free and we feel like your CMS should be the same.  That’s why we’re supporting unlimited sites and up to 3 guest users per site.

## Guest Users

Get up to 3 Guest users per site on all plans. A “Guest” is a single-site user with limited permissions (similar to an “editor”).  People typically use Guest accounts for clients, friends, or outside collaborators who want access to a single site.

## Unlimited Sites

With GitHub, you can set up unlimited repos and we feel it should be the same for your Forestry sites.  You can now manage unlimited sites with Forestry on all plans (including free).  The free plan only allows up to 3 Guest users per site, so if you need to manage a large team upgrade to the Business plan.

## Manage Branches

Many of our users set up multiple branches in Forestry. They do this by creating a new site for every branch in their repository. For example, if your repository has a staging branch and a production branch, you can set those up as two separate sites within Forestry at no extra cost. If you’re on the Business plan, you can manage your users across all of your branches from a single Organization.

## Business Plan

Now you can set up a Forestry organization to manager your users across all of your sites.  The Business plan is an Organization Account account (like an Organization account in GitHub). It allows you to manage users and their roles for your entire organization.
