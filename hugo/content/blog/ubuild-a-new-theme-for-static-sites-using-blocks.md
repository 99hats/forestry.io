In April [we announced a feature](https://forestry.io/blog/blocks-give-your-editors-the-power-to-build-pages/) that we believed was a game-changer for static site content managers. [Blocks](https://forestry.io/blog/sawmill-layout-composer-for-hugo-and-forestry/#/) was here to introduce a way for you to put together sites using pre-composed site snippets inside Forestry.

While we did our best to show you how to set them up and give you an idea of how powerful they could be, we noticed that getting to know Blocks and figuring out how to set them up from scratch wasn't as easy as we had hoped. We needed something that would guide people to success.

Enter our brand new theme for Jekyll and Hugo - uBuild! This fully-responsive theme comes with 16 design blocks to put together your favorite site. Our Norwegian designer [@nichlaswa](https://twitter.com/nichlaswa) made sure it looked stunning but see for yourself.

<div id="import-ubuild-theme-button" data-proofer-ignore>
{{% create_site_button
repo="https://github.com/forestryio/ubuild-jekyll"
branch="master"
engineName="jekyll"
engineVersion="3.6.0"
forkName="jekyll-ubuild"
heading="Make it Your Own"
linkText="Import Jekyll uBuild Now" %}}
</div>

## The Theme

uBuild consists of six main sections:

- Navigation Bar
- Hero Section
- Content Feature
- Detail Section
- 1-2-3 columns
- Footer

Each section has 1-3 blocks you can choose with different stylings. 


## Why We Made *uBuild*

uBuild is intended to give you a starting point for adding page builder functionality to your own site, but is complete enough that you can use it as-is and add new components as you see fit.

<div class="create-site-block" data-proofer-ignore>
    <h2>Let's Roll</h2>
    <a href="#/add-site" class="create-site-button">Import Jekyll uBuild Now</a>
</div>

## Future

We have big plans for Blocks!

An open-source theme is a great start but we understand that won't fulfill all your needs. We'd like to build an entire Blocks suite from which you can pick and choose as you desire. So as we proceed with our exploration of this tool we're going to add to it and to do that we'd love to have your [feedback and contributions](https://github.com/forestryio/ubuild-blocks).

Anything that could be assembled with pre-defined code blocks can be built with Blocks. We'd love for you to share with the community what you've built using Forestry Blocks.
