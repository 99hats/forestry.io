Today we introduce Blocks - a powerful Field Type that enables your editors to build entire landing pages from scratch and enrich blog posts without the help of a developer.

## What is Blocks?

Blocks is a Field Type that is made up of multiple templates. These templates are repeatable layouts that can be used in a variety of combinations.

Using Blocks editors can compose and reorganize entire pages without the support of a developer.

## How do Blocks work?

The developer creates the templates as clean code chunks and defines what templates make up a Blocks Field. The editor can then arrange and compose these pre-defined blocks without affecting the code itself.
