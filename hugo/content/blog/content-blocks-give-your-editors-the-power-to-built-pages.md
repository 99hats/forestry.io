Today we introduce Blocks - a powerful Field Type that enables your editors to build entire landing pages from scratch and create rich blog post layouts without the help of a developer.

This is a big deal and here is why!

## What is Blocks?

Blocks is a Field Type that is made up of multiple templates. These templates are repeatable layouts that can be used in a variety of combinations.

Blocks makes it possible to create pages like our homepage within minutes.

We created a \[Starter Kit Repository\](link to sawmill) and a \[Tutorial\](link to frontend friday article) so you can get started right away.

## How do Blocks work?

The developer creates the templates as clean code chunks and defines what templates make up a Blocks Field. The editor can then bootstrap entire pages composing and rearranging these pre-defined blocks without affecting the code itself.

To give an idea of what is happening behind the scenes we created this :point_up:

## Need to know more?

We just published a Frontend Friday article providing an in-depth explanation on how to use blocks and set them up.
