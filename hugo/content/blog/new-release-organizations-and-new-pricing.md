I am so happy to share with you the exciting news about our latest update - *Organizations*! In addition to our new pricing structure, you can now scale at your own pace and collaborate with ease.

Let me give you a quick tour of the ways you can engage, collaborate and grow with your team on Forestry.io.

Are you on our Personal Plan? Check out your new features [here](link to jump to invite guests)

## Organizations

— Overview page for Team Members — 

**Add Unlimited sites**
Until now our upgrades were on a page-by-page basis. No more. With *Organizations*, you can add as many sites as you need with the same permissions and capabilities across all of your sites. 

Now you don’t have to worry whether you should add another site to your dashboard.

**Seize Control**
We wanted to enable you to add, manage and remove team members with a few simple clicks. Over are the days when you had to look through each individual site to check permissions or reassign roles. 

*Organizations* give you the ability to keep track of team members and permissions on one view. Just click on Users in your *Organizations’s* settings and see your entire team including their roles.

[Try *Organizations* for Free](lalala)
No credit card required. 14-day free trial on all plans.

**Invite Guests** *(incl. Personal Plan)*
We thought it should be super easy for you to collaborate with your team members, clients, guest bloggers and friends on your favorite web projects. Limiting your website to one user at a time made that a little difficult. 

— Screenshot of how you can add Guests - Click on … in Dashboard — 

That made sense to us. From now on you can add up to three guests to any site on your dashboard. These guests can add, edit and publish content. No more unnecessary password sharing.

**Grow Your Team**
You shouldn’t have to take time to figure out pricing. It should be simple and easy to understand. Here is what we came up with.

— Updated Screenshot of Pricing Page — 

Our starter kit for teams of up to 5 members costs $29/Month and any additional team member will be priced at +$9/Month. That's it.

## Something else...

We also changed the way you can [add sites](https://app.forestry.io/dashboard/#/add-site) to your dashboard now. The Add Site Flow is significantly simplified. Now adding another site is just three quick steps away.

1. Selecting an Engine - Hugo or Jekyll
2. Selecting your Git Provider - GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab
3. Selecting your Site’s location (e.g. your repository)

Let us know what you think!
