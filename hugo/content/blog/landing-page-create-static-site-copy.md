# Create-Static-Site

A zero-configuration, modern, production-ready build pipeline for your static site

\[Hugo logo + Jekyll logo\]

## Easy Installation

_(_[_npx_](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) _comes with npm 5.2+ and higher)_

### Hugo

`npx create-static-site my-site --template hugo`
`cd my-site`
`npm start`

### Jekyll

_ruby and bundler required_

`npx create-static-site my-site --template jekyll`
`cd my-site`
`bundle install`
`npm start`

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your site.

## Modern Asset Pipeline

Add modern web development tools to your website with CLI.

### Cross-browser and legacy browser support

Automatically autoprefix your CSS to work across different browsers and versions.

### Live-Reloading via BrowserSync

Automatically reload the browser window when changes are detected.

### Use JavaScript Tools

Organize your code in modules, use the latest JavaScript language features and minify for the best performance.

### Optimize Images

Images are automatically optimized and SVG are compressed in a single spritesheet.

## Hassle-free Updates

There is no need to maintain the configuration yourself, everything can be handled with a single-dependency.

**Need a more custom solution?** Use Create-Static-Site to get a jump start on your configuration and just eject the project when you make your changes.
_Please note that from that point on you’ll have to maintain the build configuration yourself._
