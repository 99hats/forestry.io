## I. You Need a Website

Quintus had an idea. The year was 2018, and he knew that any good idea needed a website. He went to work post-haste creating his website, and after much labor, he had one.

“Well,” he thought to himself, “it’s better than nothing.” Quintus knew, however, that this would not do. He needed to find a web developer.

After a brief search, he found a talented developer named Prima. Prima was happy to help Quintus realize his vision.

“I really need it to pop,” Quintus said. So Prima made it pop.

Prima was a JAMStack devotee and knew all about the technical and performance advantages of static sites, so she used Hugo to build the site. Knowing that Quintus would want to manage his own content, she wisely used the [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io) to provide a rich interface for creating and editing content.

## II. WYSIWYG Woes

Quintus loved his new website. It was modern, sophisticated, and would enable him to broadcast his ideas to a global audience. It was time to unveil his “killer app”. He created a new page in the Forestry CMS.

It was a terrific fight. Quintus was not happy with the result, but knew he was not going to do any better. He called Prima to complain. *Why did this page look so terrible?*

“It’s the WYSIWYG,” Prima said. “They’re always a pain to use.”

Quintus was only getting more frustrated. Prima’s next 6 words sent him over the edge:

“What are you trying to do?” She asked.

A flurry of profanities ensued. Prima relented and agreed to fix up the page. She also said she would set up some shortcodes to make it easier next time. Quintus didn’t know what shortcodes were, but it sounded like they would help.

Quintus was happy.
