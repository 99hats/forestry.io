It is an understatement to say we weren't the biggest fans of Wordpress. In fact our entire business is built on the idea that static sites provide a more secure, flexible and performant environment than Wordpress. 

Yet, I'm excited to announce that today we're moving our Forestry.io website to Wordpress. Here is why we believe this is the right move.

1. We love a simple UI and Forestry.io CMS has done its absolute best to create a seamless, simple UI that is customized to any static site. However, not all sites have the same needs and our UI has its limits. Our content editors are asking for more insights on the dashboard and Wordpress provides a UI that is easy to read and doesn't feel crowded. We don't need a customized UI we need a UI that does more in one screen.

2. Yes, we would lie if we'd say there weren't any problems that come with a Wordpress blog, in fact the vulnerability of the platform can be excruciating to a developer (e.g. WWSoD, Database errors, exposed databases - the list goes on), but the team at Wordpress is constantly working on fixing these issues. While many developer hours will go into maintaining this site, the familiarity of the Wordpress UI is priceless to our editors.

3. Lastly, the plugins. No other platform provides the same portfolio that Wordpress does. We want site counters, easy-to-implement generic analytics and the ability to quickly add the capability of new technologies through plugins. We can in fact save many hours in development by using a readily available plugin in the marketplace.

At Forestry.io we love experimentation, whether its features, design or communication. The majority of these experiments won't ever reach you (unless you [join our slack channel](url)) and moving to Wordpress is just another one of these experiments, if it goes well you can look forward to Forestry.io being an active contributor to the Wordpress Marketplace. 

No worries if you like our CMS that will stay, too. Enough said check out our new site [here](fake-site).
