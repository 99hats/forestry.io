Happy New Year! We're starting into 2019 with an exciting new feature. Today we can announce S3 support as an image storage provider for Forestry.

With S3 support you can now store your images outside of your repo and take control of your image handling. The S3 integration makes it possible to efficiently store, organize and deliver images while keeping the editing experience simple and clean in Forestry.

![](/uploads/2019/01/Forestry S3.jpg)Editors, marketers and writers can continue to use the Forestry Media Library without even knowing that they are using S3 in the backend.

Add images to your S3 Bucket via Forestry and handle image manipulation with popular solutions like [imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/quick-start) or [Serverless-Image-Handler](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/web-applications/serverless-image-handler/).
