Happy New Year! We're starting into 2019 with an exciting new feature. Today we can announce S3 support as an image storage provider for Forestry.  
  
With S3 support you can now store your images outside of your repo and take control of your image handling. The S3 integration makes it possible to efficiently store, organize and deliver images while keeping the editing experience simple and clean in Forestry.

Editors, marketers and writers can continue to use the Forestry Media Library and simple tools like the drag & drop tool, making the transition as frictionless as possible.

Add images to your S3 Bucket via Forestry and handle image manipulation with AWS options such as [Serverless-Image-Handler]() or popular solutions like [imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/quick-start).
