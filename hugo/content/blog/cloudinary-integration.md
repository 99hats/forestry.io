## Image Transformation and Responsive Image Delivery

We’re happy to introduce you to an easy way to optimize your image delivery with Cloudinary and Forestry.

Static sites are fast and the delivery of resources shouldn’t slow it down. Now it is possible to use the Cloudinary CDN and have non-developers use Forestry to upload new images and add them to their content.

Cloudinary can do a lot more than just deliver your resources faster. It offers a turn-key solution for responsive images and on-the-fly image transformations. Cloudinary makes the implementation of image manipulation and optimization into your static site a breeze.

You can set up Cloudinary + Forestry in less than 3 Minutes: Create a Cloudinary Account and follow along with our [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/media/cloudinary/).

Once your account is connected you can make full use of Cloudinary’s features in your site layouts. Here are a few examples:
<div><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,e_art:hokusai,h_600/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_crop,g_face/h_565/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_600,q_150/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_600,q_150,r_30/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /></div>

Instead of uploading images through Cloudinary, your non-developers can simply upload images through Forestry’s Media Library and use them in their content.
