## Image Transformation and Responsive Image Delivery

Today we're proud to announce an easy way to optimize your image delivery with Cloudinary and Forestry.

Using Cloudinary on sites that were managed by Forestry (e.g. this site) usually resulted in verbose implementations. Now it's as simple as adding your cloud name, API key and secret to your site's settings.

As a developer you can use the super fast Cloudinary CDN the way you would with any other static site. At the same time your editors can use Forestry's Media Library and Editor to upload and manage Cloudinary assets.

You can set up Cloudinary + Forestry in less than 3 Minutes: Create a Cloudinary Account and follow along with our [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/media/cloudinary/).

Once you connect Cloudinary to your account, Forestry inserts the `image_name.extension` without any path components into your Front Matter. This gives you the maximum amount of flexibility to use Cloudinary features in your templates.

Instead of supporting a subset of Cloudinaryâ€™s features in our UI, we made it easy for developers to make use of the full set of image transformations. Here are a few examples of image manipulation through Cloudinary URLs: <div style="width:100%;min-height:150px;"><div id="img-1" onclick="showURL('http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_220/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg', 'cloudinary-url')" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_220/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg"/></div> <div id="img-2" onclick="showURL('http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_crop,g_face/h_220/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg', 'cloudinary-url')" style="display:inline-block;"> <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_crop,g_face/h_220/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg"/></div> <div id="img-3" onclick="showURL('http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,e_art:hokusai,h_220/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg', 'cloudinary-url')" style="display:inline-block;"> <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,e_art:hokusai,h_220/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg"/></div> <div id="img-4" onclick="showURL('http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_220,r_30/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg', 'cloudinary-url')" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_220,r_30/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg"/></div></div>

<div style="width:100%;min-height:20px;background-color:#f1f3f5;padding:5px"><p id="cloudinary-url" style="word-break:break-all;"></p></div> <script type="text/javascript">function showURL(url, target) {document.getElementById(target).innerHTML = url}</script> _Click on the images to check their_ `srcset` _-attribute._

This integration makes it possible to efficiently store, organize and deliver images while keeping the editing experience simple and clean. Non-developers can continue to use our simple drag and drop feature without having to juggle assets across different accounts and multiple providers.

The Forestry Media Library and Cloudinary are always in sync. All assets on Cloudinary can also be accessed through the Forestry Media Library.

# Other New Features

We also rolled out a few other feature that might be interesting to you.

## Front Matter Templates for Data Files

This update allows you to use and change templates for data files.

![](/uploads/2018/05/template-for-data-files.png)

Until now you weren't able to use templates with data files and anytime the format of the data files changed a developer needed to go into the code base.

From now on you can delegate those updating tasks and build your data file structure the way it suits you best.

## Color Picker

This new field allows your users to easily change colors of a Front Matter Field from within Forestry.

![](/uploads/2018/05/color_picker.png)

You can add values through HEX, RGB or pick a color from the selector.

## OAuth Login for Admin

The remote admin now also works for OAuth logins.
