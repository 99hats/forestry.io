## Image Transformation and Responsive Image Delivery

We’re happy to introduce you to an easy way to optimize your image delivery with Cloudinary and Forestry.

Static sites are fast and the delivery of resources shouldn’t slow it down. Now it is possible to use the Cloudinary CDN and have non-developers use Forestry to upload new images and add them to their content.

You can set up Cloudinary + Forestry in less than 3 Minutes: Create a Cloudinary Account and follow along with our [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/media/cloudinary/).

Instead of supporting a subset of Cloudinary’s features in our UI, we made it easy for developers to make use of the vast array in the site templates. Here are a few examples: <div><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,e_art:hokusai,h_600/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_crop,g_face/h_565/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_600,q_150/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /><img style="display: inline-block;" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dljtb0dbc/image/upload/c_scale,h_600,q_150,r_30/v1527559425/uploads/2018/05/29/girl.jpg" /></div>

Your non-developers can continue uploading images through Forestry’s Media Library and use them in their content.

# Other New Features

## Front Matter Templates for Data Files

Until now you weren't able to make use of Data files in the same way you could interact with other content on Forestry. That didn't seem right.

This update allows you to change templates of data files in the same way you can with articles, pages, etc.

## Color Picker
